### Carrom 
In this example, the `div` element sets the dimensions and background color of the square, and the **position: fixed** property makes sure that the squares stay in their positions even when the page is scrolled. The **.top-right, .top-left, .bottom-right, and .bottom-left** classes position the squares on the four corners of the page using the **top, right, bottom, and left** properties.

### Push Button
In this example, four `div` elements are nested inside each other, where the outer `div` stays in square shape, while child `div`s have a circle shape via css **border-radius** property. This exercise was completed using css variables, css **position** property.
